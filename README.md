# B-Tree
### CSC212: Data Structures & Algorithms Term Project <br> Lawrence Cabbabe, Aaron Levesque, Ben Uthoff, Sam Zhong

## Code Compilation
To compile B-Tree in the command line, use g++. Although other versions may work, C++11 is used to ensure consistency.
```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp btree.cpp -o btree
```
## Program Execution
The B-Tree program can be executed with command-line arguments, or interfaced with using C++ `cin` when no arguments are provided.
## Visualization via DOT File
The program writes a file called `btree.dot`, which can be read using a site like [Graphviz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) ([Github](https://github.com/dreampuf/GraphvizOnline)) to draw a diagram visualization of the resulting B-Tree.
