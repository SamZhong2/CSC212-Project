B-Tree
Guidelines According to Professor:

[x] Implement the Data Structure (using classes)

[x] ensure at least `insert` & `search` methods are correct
[x] `search` must also return/print the count

[x] generate a DOT file for visualization

[x] Store the words of an input text file

[ ] for the word ($node$) in the tree, a count with the number of repeats must also be stored
