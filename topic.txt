B-Tree
Guidelines According to Professor:

[ ] Implement the Data Structure (using classes)

[ ] ensure at least `insert` & `search` methods are correct
[ ] `search` must also return/print the count

[ ] generate a DOT file for visualization

[ ] Store the words of an input text file

[ ] for the word ($node$) in the tree, a count with the number of repeats must also be stored
